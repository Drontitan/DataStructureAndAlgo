here in the image u can see that if we  follow the same mwthod as we have done in the undirected graph
then we have considered the 3-4-5-7 as the cycle node but it not like that

we have to make one path visited array if the node is visited in that path then it is called as the cycle
int the path like the  8-9-10 does
